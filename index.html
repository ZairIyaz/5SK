        <h3>The Memories</h3>
        <p>"Our class was more than a classroom — it was a family. We supported each other every step of the way." Our time in 5 Sains Komputer was more than just books and exams — it was a journey filled with laughter, friendship, and unforgettable moments. From group studies to class jokes, from stressful nights to proud celebrations, every memory shaped who we are today. We grew not just as students, but as a family that supported one another through it all. Though we may go our separate ways, these memories will always remind us where we came from — and the bond we’ll always share.</p>

        <h3>The End Of Journey</h3>
        <p>The End — But Not Goodbye

            And now, we’ve reached the final page of our story together in 5 Sains Komputer. It’s hard to believe how quickly time has flown — from our very first day in class to our final moments as schoolmates.
            
            But this ending is not a goodbye. It’s a new beginning.
            
            Some of us will continue our journey to universities like UiTM, UTeM, and other public institutions. Some will join polytechnics, matriculation colleges, or pursue diplomas at private and government colleges. Others may step into the working world, chasing different dreams in their own unique ways.
            
            No matter where we go — whether it’s engineering, IT, education, design, or business — we will always carry the same roots: the lessons we learned, the friendships we built, and the memories we shared right here.
            
            What united us was more than just being in the same class — it was our shared struggles, our teamwork, our laughter during tough times, and the unwavering support we gave each other.
            
            To our teachers, thank you for your guidance and patience. You saw potential in us before we saw it in ourselves.
            
            To our friends, thank you for the moments that became memories — memories we’ll look back on with smiles for years to come.
            
            This may be the end of our time as classmates, but the bond of 5 Sains Komputer will always live on — in every one of us, wherever life takes us next.
            
            Till we meet again, fellas.</p>
